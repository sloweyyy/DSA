# LeetCode & Algorithmic Solutions

**Author:** SloWey  
**Email:** truonglevinhphuc2006@gmail.com

This repository documents my journey through Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) by solving LeetCode problems. I'm using this as a way to improve my coding skills and prepare for technical interviews.

## üöÄ Latest Solutions

Here are my most recent LeetCode solutions:

{latest_solutions_section}

## üìä Languages Used

Here's a breakdown of the languages I've been using, along with their contribution percentage:

{language_section}

## üìÅ Contents

*   **Codeforce Contests:** Solutions from Codeforces competitions.
*   **Codeforce Problemset:** Solutions from specific problems on Codeforces.
*   **LeetCode Daily:** My solutions to daily LeetCode challenges.
*   **Weekly Contest:** Solutions from LeetCode Weekly Contests.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*   Ensure you have the necessary compilers or interpreters installed for the languages you want to explore.

### Usage

*   Feel free to browse the code and adapt it to your needs. Each file typically contains the solution to one specific problem.
*   Use these solutions as references for understanding algorithms and coding techniques.
